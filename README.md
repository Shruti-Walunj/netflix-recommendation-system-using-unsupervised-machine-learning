# 🎬 Netflix Recommendation System Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

# 📄 Description
Analyzed and clustered a dataset of Netflix Movies and TV Shows (2019, sourced from Flixable). Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and applied machine learning models to cluster content. Built a **content-based recommender system** to suggest movies/TV shows.

# 🧩 Key Tasks

* Cleaned missing data (`cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `rating`)
* Dropped highly missing columns (`director`)
* Performed EDA on **genres, ratings, countries, durations, and release years**
* Tested hypotheses using **t-tests** and **z-tests**
* Preprocessed textual data (tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, POS tagging)
* Applied **PCA** for dimensionality reduction (captured >80% variance with 2500 components)
* Implemented **K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering**
* Evaluated clusters using **Silhouette Score**
* Built a **Content-Based Recommender System** using **Cosine Similarity**

# 📊 Insights:

* Netflix library: **69% Movies vs. 31% TV Shows**
* **TV-MA** is the most common rating (mature content dominates)
* **USA leads in content**, India strong in movies, South Korea strong in TV Shows (K-Drama)
* Peak years: **2017–2018 (Movies)** and **2019–2020 (TV Shows)**
* **90–120 minutes** is the most common movie duration
* Popular title words: *Christmas, Love, World, Story, Man*
* **International Movies, Dramas, Comedies** are top genres
* Indian actors (Shah Rukh Khan, Anupam Kher) among the most frequent on Netflix
* Final Model: **K-Means (6 clusters)** gave the best separation
* Built **Top-10 recommendations system** for Movies/TV Shows
